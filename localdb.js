    "Perform CPR. Check the person's breathing. If they are not breathing normally, begin CPR. Push hard and fast on the person's chest, around 100 â€“ 120 compressions per minute. If you are trained in CPR, deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. Keep doing this until an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available or the ambulance arrives.Use an AED. AEDs have a recorded voice which will give you step-by-step instructions. Use the AED to check the person's heart rhythm. It will recommend delivering an electric shock if needed. If so, proceed to deliver one shock then resume CPR or do chest compressions only.",
